        "2. **Identify New Node Indices:**\n",
        "   - **new_node_indices:** These are the indices for the new nodes, calculated by adding the total number of original nodes to the range of the number of classes.\n",
        "   - **Significance:** This step identifies new node indices which ensures that the newly added nodes are correctly indexed and distinct from the original nodes. It also maintains the integrity of the graph structure and enables accurate reference & manipulation in subsequent steps.\n",

        "     - **selected_paper_indices:** Concatenate the selected indices from the current subject and any subject.\n",
        "     - **citing_paper_indx:** This is the index of the new node that cites other papers.\n",
        "     - **Create new edges** from the new node (citing_paper_indx) to the selected papers (cited_paper_idx).\n",
        "   - **Significance:** New Edges creation establishes relationships (citations) between new nodes and existing nodes, reflecting the interconnected nature of the data.\n",
        "4. **Update Edge List:**\n",
        "     - **new_citations:** Convert the list of new citations to a NumPy array and transpose it.\n",
        "     - **new_edges:** Concatenate the original edges with the new citations to create the updated list of edges.\n",
        "     - **Significance:** Tthe final concatenation step updates the graph (Graph update) to include both the new nodes and the new edges, making it ready for further analysis or model training."
